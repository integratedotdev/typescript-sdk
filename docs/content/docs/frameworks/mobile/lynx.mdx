description: Integrate the Integrate SDK with Lynx cross-platform framework
---

The Integrate SDK provides seamless integration with Lynx through client-side configuration. This guide assumes you have a Lynx project and a backend server running with the Integrate SDK configured (see the backend framework guides for setting up the server).

## Installation

Install the Integrate SDK in your Lynx project:

```bash
bun add integrate-sdk
```

## Setup

Create a client configuration file with your OAuth credentials:

```typescript
// src/lib/integrate.ts
import { createMCPClient, githubIntegration } from "integrate-sdk";

export const client = createMCPClient({
  apiBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
  integrations: [
    githubIntegration({
      scopes: ["repo", "user"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Usage Examples

### Client-Side Authorization

The client is automatically configured when making requests to the server.

```typescript
import { client } from "./lib/integrate";

await client.authorize("github");
```
